_Algumas informações sobre o projeto NumPy e a comunidade_

NumPy é um projeto de código aberto visando habilitar a computação numérica com Python. Foi criado em 2005, com base no trabalho inicial das bibliotecas Numerical e Numarray. O NumPy sempre será um software 100% de código aberto, livre para que todos usem e disponibilizados sob os termos liberais da [licença BSD modificada](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

O NumPy é desenvolvido no GitHub, através do consenso da comunidade NumPy e de uma comunidade científica em Python mais ampla.
